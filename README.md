# AndroidMalware-CGDATASET

CallGraph Dataset is a dataset provided by a static model to perform malware detection on Android applications. This dataset is based on a static model. The model used to gather this dataset mines only the callgraph of the android application.

# Purpose
The approach to obtain this dataset only investigates the features present on the application's callgraph. Furthermore, this dataset is improving with featuretools (https://www.featuretools.com/) to increase its accuracy. Finally, after using it, you can read the result with a neural network model (deep learning) analysis on the dataset (Random Forest and SVM algorithms) and a k-folds approach with ten occurrences.

|Algorithms|Accuracy|Precision|Recall|F1_Score|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Neural Network|0.957|0.957|0.957|0.957|


# Dataset Population

Be careful, this dataset has not got any benignware. It is based on CICandMAL2017 (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/andmal2017.html) version provided by the University of New Brunswick and the addition of "VirusShare" samples. This dataset is not used to detect the boolean statement but to identify the most probable malware type of app analyzed on the model. You find the composition of dataset as follow :

|Adware|Banking|Ramsonware|Riskware|Scareware|SMS|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1354|2506|101|4362|112|4932|

The neural network model used to obtain this result has the following layers composition :

|InputLayer|Hidden1|Hidden2|Hidden3|Hidden4|Hidden5|OutpoutLayer|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|46|30|30|6|30|30|6|

# Features metrics

You can find the list of features in the file directly.


# Availability
This dataset is under an open-source license, but the model's code is unavailable for privacy reasons. However, if you have any questions before using it, you can contact me by e-mail (damien.strullu@gmail.com) or Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/damienstrullu/). This dataset is not available for commercial purpose and makes no warranty for such use.

If you use this dataset, thanks to mention this in your work.

# Special Thanks

This dataset is obtained due to the participation of "VirusShare" (https://virusshare.com/) and "The University of New Brunswick" (https://www.unb.ca/) to provide all malware samples.
